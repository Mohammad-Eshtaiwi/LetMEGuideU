            Dryad Soraka bio: Too many forget that the heart of the Elderwood
            was once gentle and kind. Within its confines rested fae, sylvans,
            and dryads, creatures from another age, who looked upon humanity
            with curious eyes. Now only a scattered few remain, and fewer still,
            like Soraka, who regard humans fondly.
